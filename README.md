# OVERVIEW
DAIKON is an AI-enabled drug discovery platform designed to manage, integrate, and accelerate TB drug discovery across distributed research organizations. It supports the full lifecycle from target ideation → screening → hit assessment → portfolio → post-portfolio, combining experimental data, chemical intelligence, structural biology, and AI-driven knowledge extraction into a single system of record. 
Since its original conception as a target screening database, DAIKON has evolved into a AI research platform supporting 100K+ compounds, and multiple concurrent discovery programs.

# VISION
DAIKON will function as an AI-augmented scientific co-pilot, enabling researchers to:
- Systematically evaluate and prioritize biological targets
- Rapidly assess chemical quality, liability, and novelty
- Integrate AI predictions directly into experimental decision-making
- Preserve institutional knowledge across years of discovery


# Target Users
# Primary and Exclusive Users
TBDA Consortium Members, including:
- Medicinal chemists
- Structural biologists
- Screening and assay scientists
- Computational chemists and AI scientists
- Bioinformaticians
- Program and portfolio leads
These users operate across academia, pharma, biotech, and non-profit organizations within the TBDA consortium and collaborate on shared TB drug discovery programs.
